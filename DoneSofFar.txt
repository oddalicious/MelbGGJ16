COMPLETED:
Stage system "Days"
When the player jumps into the teleporter (currently on the mound for the sake of testing) it checks to see what state they're up to, and then the 'end-day condition', if it's done, it sets it to the next day. Either way it resets
the Play aspects.
I've added the Objects for the first few objectives, they largely just disappear when activated, this will be replaced with animations or some other alternative when possible.
The Rat follows a Spline system around the map, this is located on the RatSpline object.
The Laps system was to be implemented by triggering a series of 'posts' around the map a few times. The post trigger has been crudely implemented but the handling has not.
The Spinning condition has been implemented but the trigger has not.

The Objective gets the other objects on Start (Constructor Method), and the other objects do the same.
